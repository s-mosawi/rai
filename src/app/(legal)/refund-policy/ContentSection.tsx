          This Refund Policy (“Policy”) applies to certification services
          provided by Responsible AI Australia ABN 16 675 184 291 (“RAIA”, “us”,
          “we”) unless stated otherwise.
          <br />
          <br /> The purpose of this Policy is to provide guidance to
          prospective and continuing clients regarding the circumstances under
          which a refund may be appropriate. While RAIA is not required under
          its rules to refund any fees, we ensure full compliance with the
          Australian Consumer Law (ACL) to meet reasonable expectations
          regarding refunds and remedies.
          <br />
          <br /> If you have any questions arising which are not addressed in
          this Policy, please feel free to contact us using the methods
          described at the end of this Policy under the heading “Contact Us.”

            Client satisfaction is our priority

          <br />
          <br /> At Responsible AI Australia, client satisfaction is our top
          priority. <br />
          <br /> Although RAIA is not obligated to refund any fee payments, we
          will, in good faith, consider refund requests when it is
          determined—after a thorough review by our staff—that a paid service
          has failed to meet our standards or expectations. <br />
          <br /> It is important to note that you cannot seek a refund if you
          simply change your mind. <br />
          <br /> Furthermore, by applying for Responsible AI certification, you
          acknowledge that we conduct unique processes to maintain the
          credibility of the services we provide. Therefore, if your
          organization fails to achieve certification after all due diligence
          processes are conducted, you cannot seek a refund.
